# Paper Writing Review Rubric

Use this rubric when reviewing a manuscript from the perspective of writing quality, reviewer readability, format discipline, and idea presentation. This file is not a replacement for scientific validation; it diagnoses how the paper communicates its scientific value.

## Review Dimensions

Score each dimension on 1-5 when enough text is available.

| Dimension | Weight | What To Inspect |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Storyline and motivation | 10 | Whether the paper makes the problem, gap, and stakes unavoidable before presenting the method. |
| Contribution display | 10 | Whether contributions are specific, non-overlapping, evidence-backed, and visible in abstract/introduction/conclusion. |
| Paragraph logic | 10 | Whether each paragraph has one job, a clear topic sentence, causal flow, and no mixed objectives. |
| Claim-evidence alignment | 12 | Whether every strong claim is supported by experiment, proof, citation, example, or qualified language. |
| Method readability | 9 | Whether notation, modules, algorithm steps, assumptions, and design choices are introduced in the right order. |
| Experiment narration | 9 | Whether tables/figures are introduced before interpretation and whether the text explains what each result proves. |
| Related-work positioning | 8 | Whether closest work is compared on technical axes rather than listed chronologically. |
| Terminology and notation consistency | 8 | Whether key terms, symbols, dataset names, model names, and claims stay stable across sections. |
| Prose discipline and voice | 10 | Whether the paper avoids defensive/incremental framing, label-heavy symbols, number-only abstracts, formula dumping, third-person manuscript narration, punctuation-driven structure, unsupported hype, and overlong compound sentences. |
| LaTeX and format discipline | 6 | Whether the manuscript follows venue style, references, captions, labels, equations, algorithms, and page/line constraints. |
| Reviewer-facing risk | 8 | Whether the writing creates avoidable rejection risks: hidden contribution, exaggerated claim, missing limitation, unclear baseline, or inconsistent story. |

Weights sum to 100. Compute:

```text
Writing score (1-5) = sum(assessed dimension score * weight) / sum(assessed weights)
Writing risk band = low / moderate / high / severe
```

Mark inapplicable criteria `N/A` and unavailable text `not assessed`; neither is zero. Show assessed weight coverage for a partial score and omit the aggregate if no dimension can be assessed. Preserve frozen weights for an existing version comparison. Do not present the writing score as an acceptance probability. It measures communication risk and reviewer readability, not scientific validity.

## Quantitative Writing Feedback

Include this scorecard in standard writing review:

| Dimension | Weight | Score (1-5) | Confidence (1-5) | Evidence basis | Concrete repair |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| Storyline and motivation | 10 |  |  |  |  |
| Contribution display | 10 |  |  |  |  |
| Paragraph logic | 10 |  |  |  |  |
| Claim-evidence alignment | 12 |  |  |  |  |
| Method readability | 9 |  |  |  |  |
| Experiment narration | 9 |  |  |  |  |
| Related-work positioning | 8 |  |  |  |  |
| Terminology and notation consistency | 8 |  |  |  |  |
| Prose discipline and voice | 10 |  |  |  |  |
| LaTeX and format discipline | 6 |  |  |  |  |
| Reviewer-facing risk | 8 |  |  |  |  |

For each score of 3 or below, name the location, the reviewer confusion it creates, and the smallest edit that would raise the score.

## Score Anchors

### 5

The section or paper reads like a strong venue submission: the story is precise, claims are supported, transitions are natural, figures/tables carry evidence, and formatting does not distract.

### 4

Readable and mostly reviewer-proof, but one or two issues still weaken emphasis, evidence alignment, or consistency.

### 3

Understandable but not review-ready. A strict reviewer can follow the work, yet the presentation leaves avoidable doubts about contribution, motivation, evidence, or scope.

### 2

Hard to review fairly. The writing hides the actual contribution, mixes claims, breaks logical order, or leaves major claims unsupported.

### 1

Submission-risk level. The manuscript is incoherent, format-noncompliant, internally inconsistent, or impossible to evaluate from the provided text.

## No-Filler Deduction Format

Every material issue must use:

```text
Location:
Problem:
Why a reviewer deducts:
Concrete edit:
Expected effect:
```

Do not write "improve clarity", "strengthen motivation", "add details", or "polish language" without naming the exact sentence/paragraph role, missing information, and edit action.

## Prose Anti-Pattern Deductions

Apply `../../../ccf-paper-writer/references/prose-quality-guardrails.md`. Flag these as writing risks even when the science is otherwise plausible:

- Defensive or incremental framing that makes the contribution sound like a patch instead of a scientific insight.
- `Q1`/`C1`/`RQ1`-style labels used as the main narrative structure.
- Abstracts dominated by numbers before the task, gap, insight, and method are clear.
- Dense theorem, formula, or notation blocks with no explanation of why they matter.
- Excessive quotation marks, colons, dashes, slash stacks, arrows, or custom symbols replacing natural transitions.
- Third-person manuscript voice, such as "this paper proposes" or "the authors show", in text meant to be the manuscript itself.
- Repeated concepts or inconsistent terms that make the argument feel mechanically generated.
- Paragraphs whose sentences have the same length, template, or rhetorical rhythm.

## Writing Review Panel

Use the relevant perspectives below within the standard report. Call them independent only when separate reviewer calls were actually performed:

- **Storyline reviewer:** checks problem -> gap -> root challenge -> insight -> evidence progression.
- **Skeptical reviewer-reader:** checks where the prose makes the work look weaker, more incremental, or less supported than it is.
- **Claim-evidence reviewer:** checks unsupported, over-broad, or misplaced claims.
- **Paragraph-logic reviewer:** checks topic sentences, paragraph jobs, transitions, and redundancy.
- **Venue-style reviewer:** checks target-venue expectations, contribution display, and figure/table narration.
- **LaTeX/format reviewer:** checks captions, labels, equations, algorithms, references, anonymity markers, and page-risk signals.

Each role must output:

```text
Role:
Writing score tendency:
Confidence:
Main readability gain:
Main reviewer-confusion risk:
Evidence basis:
Concrete edit:
Expected score movement:
```

Do not force praise or criticism. If a role finds the section acceptable on its axis, state why and move to the next role.

## Writing-Only Boundaries

- Do not invent results, citations, baselines, or theorem claims.
- Do not silently rewrite the idea. When a scientific claim is too strong for the evidence, recommend weakening, qualifying, moving, or requesting evidence.
- Do not give acceptance probabilities. Report writing risk and likely reviewer confusion.
- If the user asks for actual rewriting, follow CCFA handoff mode before using `ccf-paper-writer`.
