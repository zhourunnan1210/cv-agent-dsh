# Source Notes

Use this file when explaining writing-review provenance or checking current official venue rules.

## Shared Registry

The authoritative CCFA source inventory is:

```text
../ccf-common/references/source-registry.yaml
```

Do not duplicate long URL lists in this skill. Add or update public source records in the shared registry, then run:

```powershell
python ..\ccf-common\scripts\check_sources.py
```

## Writing-Reviewer Use Rules

- Use official venue criteria for template, anonymity, page limit, artifact, ethics, and formatting rules when current-year policy matters.
- Verify official pages again when the user asks for latest-year requirements, review forms, page limits, anonymity, artifacts, ethics, or deadlines.
- Use CS paper-reading, peer-review, and author-guideline sources as method scaffolds, not as venue-specific scoring rules.
- Use explicit scoring anchors and evidence to keep diagnostic signals consistent; do not claim exact percentiles or acceptance probability without a real calibration dataset.
- Convert every writing deduction into a location-specific revision action so the review can feed `ccf-paper-writer` when allowed by the CCFA handoff mode.
- For LaTeX/format issues, prefer the target venue's official template first; use ACM/IEEE author resources only when they match the user's venue family or provide general source-audit scaffolding.
