# Exemplar Index

Use this index when the user asks for CCF A-level paper writing, best-paper style, venue-specific adaptation, default user-custom writing, or examples from strong papers. Load only the cards that match the target paper. Do not load every card by default.

## Default Custom Format

When the target venue is not specified, load `references/custom-format/default-user-format.md` first. That format currently uses the user's two custom exemplar cards:

| Role | Venue | Card | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User custom exemplar | ICLR family | `cards/llava-4d.md` | 4D scene understanding, spatiotemporal prompts, dataset plus model papers |
| User custom exemplar | CVPR | `cards/vggt.md` | feed-forward geometry, multi-task visual prediction, simple model versus optimization |

These two cards are user-custom writing-format sources. Do not treat them as ordinary venue best-paper cards unless the user explicitly asks to compare against ICLR/CVPR best-paper style.

## Selection Rule

Start with the one best-matching card when style adaptation is needed; load only its relevant sections. Add cards only to answer a distinct writing question, up to four for a full manuscript. This index does not require exemplars for a local edit:

- Use the custom-format cards first when no target venue is specified.
- Use same venue or venue family first when a target venue is specified.
- Use same evidence type second: theorem, benchmark, user study, system, dataset, or ablation-heavy model.
- Use same story shape third: new task, new benchmark, new model family, new capability, or new evaluation economy.
- Add a contrast card only when it resolves a concrete story or evidence-presentation choice.

Use cards to borrow writing moves, not claims, wordings, examples, or technical content.

## ICLR And CVPR Recent Best-Paper Cards

## Non-AI/CV/NLP Venue Cards

Use these cards when the target venue is outside the dominant AI/CV/NLP cluster. They are meant to prevent the writing skill from forcing every paper into an ML-style "model plus table" story.

| Venue family | Card | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SIGMOD / database systems | `cards/sigmod-2024-polardb-mp.md` | cloud-native databases, distributed transactions, storage/compute disaggregation, system architecture |

| POPL / programming languages | `cards/popl-2024-megalibm.md` | program synthesis, numerical libraries, PL/tool papers with formal and empirical evidence |
| CHI / HCI | `cards/chi-2024-constrained-highlighting.md` | user-study papers, interaction technique evaluation, human-centered evidence |
| STOC/FOCS / theory | `cards/stoc-2024-theory-best-paper.md` | theorem-first papers, lower/upper-bound stories, proof roadmap and technical barrier framing |

## Style And Citation Guides

When loading exemplar cards, also follow the writing style and citation rules established in the main skill references:

- `references/research-writing-patterns.md` (Natural Writing Style section): prose flow, forbidden patterns (no bold labels, no citation dumps), citation weaving.
- `references/citation-workflow.md`: search-bib-cite workflow, citation density per section, natural citation patterns.
- `references/output-style-policy.md` (Citation Format Rules): claim-first citation style, no author-name subjects, bib file as source of truth.

The exemplar cards provide structural patterns. The style guides provide execution rules. Use both.

## Output Reminder

After loading cards, produce:

1. Chosen exemplar set and why each card fits.
2. Transferable writing moves.
3. Drafting warnings where an exemplar's confidence would not be supported by the user's evidence.
4. A section plan or revision that is original to the user's paper.
