## Abstract


We introduce BRICKGPT, the ﬁrst approach for generating physically stable interconnecting brick assembly models

from text prompts. To achieve this, we construct a large-scale, physically stable dataset of brick structures, along with their associated captions, and train an autoregressive large language model to predict the next brick to add via next-token

prediction. To improve the stability of the resulting designs, we employ an efﬁcient validity check and physics-aware rollback during autoregressive inference, which prunes infeasible token predictions using physics laws and assem-

bly constraints. Our experiments show that BRICKGPT produces stable, diverse, and aesthetically pleasing brick structures that align closely with the input text prompts. We also develop a text-based brick texturing method to gen- *Indicates equal contribution.

erate colored and textured designs. We show that our designs can be assembled manually by humans and automat-

ically by robotic arms. We release our new dataset, Stable- Text2Brick, containing over 47,000 brick structures of over 28,000 unique 3D objects accompanied by detailed captions, along with our code and models at the project website:

1. Introduction 3D generative models have made remarkable progress, driven by advances in generative modeling [16, 67] and neural rendering [27, 53]. These models have enabled various

applications in virtual reality, gaming, entertainment, and scientiﬁc computing. Several works have explored synthesizing

3D objects from text [60], adding texture to meshes [8, 63], and manipulating the shape and appearance of existing 3D This ICCV paper is the Open Access version, provided by the Computer Vision Foundation.

Except for this watermark, it is identical to the accepted version; the final published version of the proceedings is available on IEEE Xplore.


objects and scenes [20, 41].

However, creating real-world objects with existing methods remains challenging. Most approaches focus on gen-

erating diverse 3D objects with high-ﬁdelity geometry and appearance [22, 88], but these digital designs often cannot be physically realized due to two key challenges [47]. First, the objects may be difﬁcult to assemble using standard components. Second, the resulting structure may be physically un-

stable even if assembly is possible. Without proper support, parts of the design could collapse, ﬂoat, or be disconnected.

In this work, we address the challenge of generating physically realizable objects. We study this problem in the context

of designing structures made of interlocking toy bricks, such as LEGO® blocks. These are widely used in education, artistic creation, and manufacturing prototyping. Additionally,

they can serve as a reproducible benchmark, as all standard components are readily available. Due to the signiﬁcant

effort required to design brick structures manually, recent studies have developed automated algorithms to streamline the process and generate compelling results. However, existing approaches primarily create structures from a given 3D

object [46] or focus on a single object category [13, 14].

Our goal is to generate brick assembly structures directly from freeform text prompts while ensuring physical stability and buildability. Speciﬁcally, we aim to train a generative model that produces designs that are: Physically stable: Built on a baseplate with strong structural integrity, without ﬂoating or collapsing bricks.


Buildable: Compatible with standard toy brick pieces and able to be assembled brick-by-brick by humans or robots.

In this work, we introduce BRICKGPT with the key insight of repurposing autoregressive large language models,

originally trained for next-token prediction, for next-brick prediction. We formulate the problem of brick structure design as an autoregressive text generation task, where the

next-brick dimension and placement are speciﬁed with a simple textual format. To ensure generated structures are both stable and buildable, we enforce physics-aware assembly constraints during both training and inference. During

training, we construct a large-scale dataset of physically stable brick structures paired with captions. During autoregressive inference, we enforce feasibility with an efﬁcient

validity check and physics-aware rollback to ensure that the ﬁnal tokens adhere to physics laws and assembly constraints.

Our experiments show that the generated designs are stable, diverse, and visually appealing while adhering to input

prompts. Our method outperforms pre-trained LLMs with or without in-context learning, and previous approaches based on 3D mesh generation. Finally, we explore applications such as text-driven brick texturing, as well as manual assembly and automated robotic assembly of our designs. Our

dataset, code, and models are available at the project website: https://avalovelace1.github.io/BrickGPT/.

2. Related Work Text-to-3D Generation.

Text-to-3D generation has seen remarkable progress recently, driven by advances in neural rendering and generative models. Dreamfusion [60] and

Score Jacobian Chaining [78] pioneer zero-shot text-to-3D generation by optimizing neural radiance ﬁelds [53] with pretrained diffusion models [64]. Subsequent work has explored

alternative 3D representations [3, 34, 36, 43, 49, 52, 68] and improved loss functions [26, 45, 48, 76, 80, 86]. Rather than relying on iterative optimization, a promising alternative direction trains generative models directly on 3D asset

datasets, with various backbones including diffusion models [21, 33, 35, 55, 62, 65, 88, 89, 92], large reconstruction

models [22, 32, 75, 84], U-Nets [37, 70], and autoregressive models [46, 19, 56, 66, 69, 82]. However, these existing methods cannot be directly applied to generating brick structures as they do not account for the unique physical and as-

sembly constraints of real-world designs [47]. We bridge this gap by introducing a method for generating physically stable and buildable brick structures directly from text prompts.

Autoregressive 3D Modeling. Recent research has successfully used autoregressive models to generate 3D meshes [4

6, 9, 19, 56, 66, 69, 82], often conditioned on input text or images. Most recently, LLaMA-Mesh [81] demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can be ﬁne-tuned to output 3D shapes in plain-text format, given a text prompt. However, most existing autoregressive methods focus on mesh generation. In contrast, we focus on generating brick structures

from text prompts, leveraging LLMs reasoning capabilities.

Brick Assembly and Design Generation. Creating brick structures given a reference 3D shape has been widely studied [29]. Existing works [58, 71, 91] formulate the gener-

ation as an optimization problem guided by hand-crafted heuristics, such as ensuring that all bricks are interconnected and minimizing the number of bricks. Wang et al. [79] translate a visual manual into step-by-step brick assembly in-

structions. Luo et al. [46] use stability analysis to ﬁnd weak structural parts and rearrange the local brick layout to generate physically stable designs. Kim et al. [28], Liu et al. [40]

formulate a planning problem to ﬁll the target 3D model sequentially. However, these methods only generate designs given an input 3D shape, assuming a valid brick structure exists, which is difﬁcult to verify in practice.

Few works have explored learning-based techniques to generate toy brick designs. Thompson et al. [72] use a deep graph generative model in which the graph encodes brick connectivity. However, this method is limited to generating simple classes using a single brick type. More recently, Ge et al. [14] use a diffusion model to predict a semantic volume, which is then translated into a high-quality micro building.

Their method produces impressive results for a single category. Zhou et al. [90] and Ge et al. [13] generate compelling

## Approach


formulate an optimization problem to create a brick model from an input image. While their output is a 2D brick mosaic, we focus on 3D structures in this work. Goldberg et al. [15] query a vision-language model to generate diverse 3D assembly structures. However, they use regular building blocks

instead of bricks with interlocking connections, and thus the structures have limited expressiveness. Lennon et al. [31] voxelize an input image and use heuristics to convert the voxels into a brick model without considering physical constraints. In contrast, our method performs the text-to-brick

task without requiring intermediate voxel representations.

Physics-Aware Generation.

Physics-aware 3D generation can be broadly categorized into two approaches: di-

rect constraint enforcement and learned validation. Simple physical constraints, such as collision avoidance and contact requirements, can be incorporated directly through explicit penalty terms during optimization [17, 25, 42, 54, 77, 85, 87].

More complex physical properties, such as structural stability and dynamic behavior, typically require physics sim-

ulators [12, 15, 51, 57, 83] or data-driven physics-aware assessment models [10, 50]. To our knowledge, our paper is the ﬁrst attempt to incorporate physics-aware constraints into text-based brick assembly structure generation.

3. Dataset Training a modern autoregressive model requires a largescale dataset. Therefore, we introduce StableText2Brick, a

new dataset that contains 47,000+ different toy brick assembly structures, covering 28,000+ unique 3D objects from 21

common object categories of the ShapeNetCore dataset [2].

We select categories featuring diverse and distinctive 3D objects while excluding those resembling cuboids. Each struc-

ture is paired with a group of text descriptions and a stability score, which indicates its physical stability and buildability.

Below, we describe the dataset construction, an overview of which is given in Figure 2.

Brick Representation. We consider brick structures built on a ﬁxed baseplate. Each structure in StableText2Brick is represented as B = [b1, b2, . . . , bN] with N bricks, and each element denotes a bricks state as bi = [hi, wi, xi, yi, zi].

Here, hi and wi indicate the brick length in the X and Y directions, respectively, and xi, yi, and zi denote the position of the stud closest to the origin. The position has

xi [0, 1, . . . , H 1], yi [0, 1, . . . , W 1], zi [0, 1, . . . , D 1], where H, W, and D represent the dimensions of the discretized grid world.

Shape-to-Brick.

We construct the dataset by converting 3D shapes from ShapeNetCore [2] into brick structures as shown in Figure 2(a). Given a 3D mesh, we voxelize and downsample it into a 20 20 20 grid world to ensure a consistent scale, i.e., H = W = D = 20. The brick layout is generated by a delete-and-rebuild algorithm similar to [46]. To improve data quality and diversity, we introduce randomness and generate multiple different structures for the same 3D object, as illustrated in Figure 2(b). This increases the chance of obtaining a stable structure and more diverse layouts. More details can be found in Appendix A.

Stability Score.

We assess the physical stability of each structure, as illustrated in Figure 2(c), using the analysis

(c) At inference time, BRICKGPT generates brick structures incrementally by predicting one brick at a time given a text prompt. For each generated brick, we perform validity checks to ensure it is well-formatted, exists in our brick library, and does not collide with existing bricks. After completing the design, we verify its physical stability. If the structure is unstable, we roll back to a stable state by removing all unstable bricks and their subsequent bricks, and resume generation from that point.

scores si indicate greater stability, while si = 0 indicates an unstable brick that will cause structural failure. Calculating the stability score requires solving a nonlinear program

to determine the forces acting on each brick to achieve a static equilibrium that prevents structural collapse, as detailed in Section 4.2. For typically-sized (i.e., < 200 bricks)

structures in Figure 2, stability analysis takes ↔0.35 seconds on average. A structure is stable if all bricks have stability scores greater than 0; we only include stable structures in the StableText2Brick dataset.

Caption Generation.

To obtain captions for each shape, we render the brick structure from 24 different viewpoints and combine them into a single multi-view image. We then prompt GPT-4o [1] to produce ﬁve descriptions for these renderings with various levels of detail. Importantly, we ask GPT-4o to omit color information and focus only on geometry. The complete prompt is provided in Appendix A.

Figure 2(e) shows several data samples from Stable-

Text2Brick. The rich variations within each category and the comprehensive text-brick pairs make it possible to train largescale generative models. More insights on StableText2Brick

are discussed in Appendix A.

4. Method Here, we introduce BRICKGPT, a method for generating physically stable interconnecting toy brick assembly structures from text prompts. Leveraging LLMs ability to model

sequences and understand text, we ﬁne-tune a pre-trained LLM for the brick structure generation task (Section 4.1). To increase the stability and buildability of our designs, we use brick-by-brick rejection sampling and physics-aware rollback during inference (Section 4.2). Figure 3 illustrates an

overview of our method.

4.1. Model Fine-tuning Pre-trained LLMs excel at modeling sequences and understanding natural language, making them promising candi-

dates for our task. We further ﬁne-tune a pre-trained LLM on a custom instruction dataset containing text prompts and their corresponding brick structures from StableText2Brick.

Pre-trained Base Model.

We use LLaMA-3.2-1B- Instruct [11] as our base model. This model is ﬁne-tuned to give coherent answers to instruction prompts, making it suitable for text-based brick structure generation. As shown in Figure 5, the base model can generate brick structures through in-context learning, highlighting the promise of using pre-trained LLMs for our task. However, the generated

structures fail to follow the input prompt, and they contain intersecting or disconnected bricks, making them physically unstable and unbuildable. To address these issues, we further ﬁne-tune the pre-trained model using our StableText2Brick.

Instruction Fine-tuning Dataset. For each stable structure and its corresponding captions, we construct an instruction in the following format: (user) Create a LEGO model of {caption}. (assistant) {brick-structure}. To simplify training and reuse LLaMAs tokenizer, we represent brick structures

Figure 4. Force Model. (a) We consider all forces exerted on a

single brick, including gravity (black), vertical forces with the top brick (red/blue) and bottom brick (green/purple), and horizontal (shear) forces due to knob connections (cyan), and adjacent bricks (yellow). (b) The structural force model F extends the individual force model to multiple bricks. Solving for static equilibrium in F determines each bricks stability score.

in plain text. But what format should we use? The standard format LDraw [30] has two main drawbacks. First, it does not directly include brick dimensions, which are crucial for assessing the structure and validating brick placements.

Second, it includes unnecessary information such as arbitrary brick orientation and scale, which are redundant since all bricks are axis-aligned in our setting.

Instead of using LDraw, we introduce a custom format to represent each brick structure. Each line of our format represents one brick as {h}{w} ({x},{y},{z}), where h w are brick dimensions and (x, y, z) are its coordinates.

All bricks are 1-unit-tall, axis-aligned cuboids, and the order of h and w encodes the bricks orientation about the vertical axis. This format signiﬁcantly reduces the number of

tokens required to represent a design, while including brick dimension information essential for 3D reasoning. Bricks are ordered in a raster-scan manner from bottom to top.

With our ﬁne-tuned BRICKGPT model ω, we predict the bricks b1, b2, ..., bN in an autoregressive manner: p(b1, b2, ..., bN|ω) = i=1 p(bi|b1, ..., bi1, ω).

(1) 4.2. Integrating Physical Stability Although trained on physically stable data, our model sometimes generates designs that violate physics and assembly

constraints. To address this issue, we further incorporate physical stability veriﬁcation into autoregressive inference.

A brick structure is considered physically stable and buildable if it does not collapse when built on a baseplate. To this

end, we assess physical structural stability using the stability analysis method [38]. We brieﬂy overview this method

below. Figure 4(a) illustrates all possible forces exerted on a single brick. We extend the single brick model and derive the structural force model F, which consists of a set of candidate forces as shown in Figure 4(b). For a brick structure

B = [b1, b2, . . . , bN], each brick bi has Mi candidate forces F j i Fi, j [1, Mi]. A structure is stable if all bricks can reach static equilibrium, i.e., F j i = 0, i ˙= i F j i = 0, (2) where Lj i denotes the force lever corresponding to F j i . The stability analysis is formulated into a nonlinear program as arg min
#$$$$

F j $$$$ + $$$$ $$$$ + ϑDmax + ϖ (3) subject to three constraints: 1) all force candidates in F should take non-negative values; 2) certain forces exerted on the same brick cannot coexist, e.g., the pulling (red arrow) and pressing (blue arrow), the dragging (green arrow) and supporting (purple arrow); 3) Newtons third law, e.g., at a given connection point, the supporting force on the upper brick should be equal to the pressing force on the bottom brick. Di ↗Fi is the set of candidate dragging forces (green arrow) on bi. ϑ and ϖ are hyperparameter weights.

Solving the above nonlinear program in Eqn. 3 using Gurobi [18] ﬁnds a force distribution F that drives the structure to static equilibrium with the minimum required internal

stress, suppressing the overall friction (i.e., & Di) as well as avoiding extreme values (i.e., Dmax ). From the force distribution F, we obtain the per-brick stability score as

si = &Mi F j i ↘= 0 &Mi i ↘= 0 Dmax
> FT ,

FT Dmax otherwise, (4) where FT is a measured constant friction capacity between brick connections. Higher scores si indicate greater stability, while si = 0 indicates an unstable brick that will cause structural failure: either F cannot reach static equilibrium (&Mi F j ↘= 0 ≃&Mi ↘= 0) or the required friction exceeds the friction capacity of the material (Dmax
> FT ).

Due to the equality constraints imposed by Newtons third law, Eqn. 3 includes only the dragging forces and excludes pulling forces. For a physically stable structure, we need si > 0, i [1, N].

When to apply stability analysis? A straightforward approach to ensuring physical stability is to apply stability

analysis after each generated brick and resample a brick that would cause a collapse. However, this step-by-step validation could be time-consuming. More importantly, many

Instead, we propose brick-by-brick rejection

sampling combined with physics-aware rollback to balance stability and diversity.

Brick-by-Brick Rejection Sampling.

To improve inference speed and avoid overly constraining generation, we

relax our constraints during inference. First, when the model generates a brick and its position, the brick should be wellformatted (e.g., available in the inventory) and lie within

the world space. Second, the brick should not collide with the existing structure. Formally, for each generated brick bt, we have Vt Vi = ⊋, i [1, t 1], where Vi denotes the voxels occupied by bi. These heuristics allow us to efﬁciently generate well-formatted structures without explicitly considering complex physical stability. To integrate these heuristics,

we use rejection sampling: if a brick violates the rules, we resample a new brick from the model. Due to the relaxed constraints, most bricks are valid, and rejection sampling does not signiﬁcantly affect inference time.

Physics-Aware Rollback.

To ensure that the ﬁnal design B = [b1, b2, . . . , bN] is physically stable, we calcu-

late the stability score S. If the resulting design is unstable, i.e., si = 0, i I, we roll back the design to the

state before the ﬁrst unstable brick was generated, i.e., B= [b1, b2, . . . , bmin I1]. Here, I is the set of the indices of all the unstable bricks. We repeat this process iteratively until we reach a stable structure B, and continue generation from the partial structure B. Note that we can use

the per-brick stability score to efﬁciently ﬁnd the collapsing bricks and their corresponding indices in the sequence. We summarize our inference sampling in Algorithm 1.

4.3. Brick Texturing and Coloring While we primarily focus on generating the shape of a brick structure, color and texture play a critical role in creative designs. Therefore, we propose a method that applies detailed

UV textures or assigns uniform colors to individual bricks.

UV Texture Generation.

Given a structure B and its corresponding mesh M, we ﬁrst identify the set of occluded bricks Bocc that have all six faces covered by adjacent bricks, and remove Bocc for efﬁciency. The remaining bricks Bvis = B \ Bocc are merged into a single mesh M with cleaned overlapping vertices using ImportLDraw [74]. We generate a UV map UVM by cube projection. The texture map Itexture is then generated using FlashTex [8], a fast text-based mesh texturing approach: Itexture = FlashTex(M, UVM, c), (5) where text prompt c describes the visual appearance. This texture can be applied through UV printing or stickers.

Uniform Brick Color Assignment.

We can also assign each brick a uniform color from a standard color library [30].

Given a structure B, we convert it to a voxel grid V and then to a UV-unwrapped mesh MV. For every voxel v V, let f v i , i = 1, . . . , Nv be its visible faces where 0 ⇑Nv ⇑6.

Each face f v i is split into two triangles and mapped to a UV region Sv i , creating a mesh MV with UV map UVV. We apply FlashTex [8] to generate a texture Itexture: Itexture = FlashTex(MV, UVV, c).

(6) The color of each voxel C(v) R3 is computed as: C(v) = 1 i=1 C(f v i ), v V, (7) where C(f v i ) = |Sv i | (x,y)Sv i Itexture(x, y) is the color of each visible face f v i , and |Sv i | represents the number of pixels in region Sv i in the UV map. For each brick bt and its constituent voxels Vt, we compute the brick color C(bt) = |Vt| vVt C(v). Finally, we ﬁnd the closest color in the color set. While UV texturing offers higher-ﬁdelity details, uniform coloring allows us to use standard toy bricks.

5. Experiments 5.1. Implementation Details Fine-tuning. Our ﬁne-tuning dataset contains 240k distinct prompts and 47k+ distinct brick structures. We withhold 10% of the data for evaluation. For efﬁciency, we include samples only up to 4096 tokens long. Training details are provided in Appendix A.

Inference. To evaluate our method, we generate one brick structure for each of 250 prompts randomly selected from

Table 1. Quantitative Results. We evaluate our method against several baselines on validity (no out-of-library, out-of-bounds, or colliding

For LLaMA-Mesh [81], validity requires a well-formed OBJ ﬁle. Results marked + our stability analysis are augmented by generating multiple structures and choosing the ﬁrst stable one found (if any). Our method outperforms all baselines as well as the ablated setups on validity and stability using our proposed rejection sampling and rollback, while maintaining high text similarity.

We allow up to 100 physics-aware rollbacks before accepting the brick structure. The median number of required rollbacks is 2, and the median time to generate one structure is 40.8 seconds.

Baseline Comparisons.

As baselines, we use LLaMA- Mesh [81], LGM [70], XCube [62], and Hunyuan3D-2 [89] to generate a mesh from each prompt, then convert the meshes to brick structures with our delete-and-rebuild algorithm. To increase the chance of producing a stable structure,

we generate multiple different structures for the same output mesh (10 for LLaMA-Mesh and LGM; 100 for XCube

and Hunyuan3D) and accept the ﬁrst stable one found, if any. Additionally, we compare our method with pre-trained LLaMA models evaluated in both a zero-shot and few-shot manner. For few-shot evaluation, we provide the model with 5 examples of stable brick structures and their captions.

For each method, we compute the proportion of stable and valid structures among the generated designs. Additionally, for each valid structure, we compute its mean and minimum brick stability scores. To evaluate prompt alignment, we compute the CLIP score [61] between a rendered image of each

valid structure and the text A LEGO model of {prompt}.

We also calculate the alignment between rendered images of the generated structure and the ground-truth structure for the same prompt, as measured by the cosine similarity between DINOv2 features [59]. As shown in Table 1, our method outperforms all baselines in these metrics.

Ablation Study.

We demonstrate the importance of rejection sampling and physics-aware rollback. As seen in

Figure 6, rejection sampling eliminates invalid bricks, such

as those with collisions, while rollback helps to ensure the ﬁnal assembly structure is stable. The quantitative results in
Table 1 show that our full method generates a higher proportion of valid and stable brick structures, while closely


following the text prompts.

5.3. Extensions and Applications Robotic Assembly of Generated Structures. We demonstrate automated assembly using a dual-robot-arm system.


The robots use the manipulation policy [39] and the asynchronous multi-agent planner [24] to manipulate toy bricks

and construct the structure. More details are included in Appendix B. Since the generated structures are physically stable, efﬁcient automated assembly can be performed.

Manual Assembly. Our generated designs are physically valid and can be hand-assembled. See Appendix C.

Brick Texture and Color Generation.

Figure 7 shows

both UV texturing and uniform coloring results of brick structures, demonstrating our methods ability to generate diverse styles while preserving the underlying geometry.

6. Conclusion In this work, we have introduced BRICKGPT, an autoregressive model for generating interconnecting toy brick struc-

tures from text prompts. Our method predicts the next brick sequentially while ensuring physical stability and buildability. We have shown that our method outperforms LLM back-

bone models and recent text-to-3D generation methods.
