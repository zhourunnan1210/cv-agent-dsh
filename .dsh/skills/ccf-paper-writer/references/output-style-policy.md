# Output Style Policy

Use this reference when the requested writing output could conflict with the default CCFA reporting shape.

## Priority Order

1. User-requested final format.
2. `ccf-humanization` direct-academic and warning-non-injection policy.
3. Original source format for edit/polish/compression tasks.
4. Target venue LaTeX format for from-scratch manuscript tasks.
5. Target venue length/page budget for full-manuscript tasks.
6. NeurIPS LaTeX fallback when the target venue is absent, unknown, or has no local guide.
7. Compact user-review warning only after the main writing output and never injected into the artifact.

## Edit And Polish

Preserve existing structure unless the user asks for restructuring:

- LaTeX commands, environments, labels, citations, equations, comments, and section hierarchy.
- Markdown headings, tables, lists, code fences, and links.
- Paragraph count and section order when the request is "polish", "润色", "改写但不改结构", or "keep format".

If a sentence contains an unsupported claim, narrow it accurately in place or add a short warning after the revised text. Do not inject defensive caveats or turn a polish request into a long review report.

## Canonical Revision Files

Use one canonical path for each requested manuscript or writing deliverable. Ordinary iterations overwrite that file in place. Do not create version-suffixed, dated, timestamped, `revised`, `new`, or `final-final` copies unless the user explicitly requests snapshots or multiple alternatives. Keep rollback in version control. Do not save prompt drafts, critique passes, or failed rewrites beside the manuscript. Immutable submissions, user-provided source versions, and raw experiment records remain separate when preservation is scientifically or externally required.

## From Idea To Manuscript

When the user has only an idea and asks to write a paper:

1. Search `venue-guides/index.md` for the target venue.
2. Read the specific venue guide when it exists.
3. Draft a LaTeX manuscript using that venue's template conventions.
4. Establish a page/word budget from `length-budget-policy.md`; for submission-style drafts, aim near the venue limit rather than producing a short skeleton.
5. If the venue guide is missing or no venue is named, draft with the NeurIPS template path `ccf-latex-templates/NeurIPS/neurips_2026.tex`.
6. Use `TBD` for missing results, citations, figures, or implementation details.
7. For "完整文章", "full paper", "from scratch", or "投稿", include the normal paper parts for the target venue: abstract, introduction, background/related work or preliminaries, method, experiments, analysis/ablation, conclusion, references, and expected appendix/checklist placeholders. Include limitations, ethics, or reproducibility sections only when venue-required or scientifically material; do not invent defensive content to fill them.

If the first draft is substantially below the venue budget, expand with useful missing content before declaring it complete. If it exceeds the budget, run compression locally because compression is owned by `ccf-paper-writer`.

Do not block the draft because final venue policy may be stale. State the freshness risk briefly and route final compliance to `ccf-submission-checker`.

## Information-Dense Writing

Do not use the main answer for generic process narration. The first visible artifact should be the draft, revised text, table, review response, or file path requested by the user. Keep notes short and concrete:

- name the exact unsupported claim,
- name the missing evidence or file,
- name the section affected,
- name the next owner only when a handoff is useful.

For full workflow demos, produce the requested concrete artifacts. Several skills may improve the same canonical artifact; do not require a separate process file from each skill.

## Citation Format Rules

Every manuscript must follow these citation formatting rules:

1. **Natural weaving:** Citations appear as part of the narrative. The claim precedes the citation bracket. A sentence should make sense if the brackets were removed.

2. **No author-name subjects:** Do not use `Author et al. [N]` as the grammatical subject of a sentence. Use the method name, the finding, or the paradigm as the subject: "Self-attention [1]..." not "Vaswani et al. [1]..."

3. **Group with purpose:** When citing multiple works, group them by what they share: "Contrastive objectives [9,10,11]" rather than dumping "Several works [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] have studied this."

4. **Clear attribution:** Avoid redundant citation clusters when a single reference clearly supports connected statements. Repeat a citation when needed to keep attribution unambiguous; do not merge distinct claims solely to reduce citation count.

5. **Bib file as source of truth:** Every `\cite{}` key must exist in the project `.bib` file. Never write a citation from memory.

6. **No bold labels:** Do not use `\textbf{Concept:}` or `\textit{Label:}` as paragraph scaffolding. Write prose paragraphs with topic sentences and logical flow. The only exceptions are venue-mandated section headings or checklist items.

7. **Citation coverage:** Follow `references/citation-workflow.md` for support of closest work, borrowed mechanisms, datasets, and comparisons. Do not add papers or expand prose to meet a numeric quota. Reuse verified entries and preserve unrelated bibliography content.

## Flexible Suggestions

For non-review writing work, suggestions may be phrased as optional questions instead of hard blockers. Example:

```text
可以把本文定位成 benchmark + architecture paper 吗？这样 novelty 压力会小一些，但需要更强的 dataset/protocol 说明。
```

Use hard blockers only for fabricated evidence, privacy risk, incompatible user constraints, or impossible format requirements.
