# Length Budget Policy

Use this file whenever drafting, expanding, compressing, or submission-preparing a full manuscript.

## Core Rule

A venue-aware paper draft should target the venue's usable main-body budget, not merely compile. A short idea is not permission to produce a short paper when the user asked for a submission manuscript. Expand with evidence-bound content, `TBD` placeholders, and concrete experiment/analysis scaffolds rather than inventing results.

Determine exactly which sections count from the target venue/year/track rules. Do not assume references, appendices, acknowledgements, or limitations are excluded universally. Use the budget for substantive explanation, not page-filling or imagined reviewer reactions.

## Budget Setup

Before full-manuscript drafting, establish:

```text
Target venue:
Template / style:
Main-body page limit:
References counted? yes / no / unknown
Appendix counted? yes / no / unknown
Draft target:
Allowed draft tolerance:
Final submission target:
```

Use the venue guide first. If the local guide lacks a clear page limit, infer a draft target from the venue family and label it `policy-stale`; route final compliance to `ccf-submission-checker`.

Default draft targets:

- Strict page-limited submissions: aim for 85-100% of the main-body limit.
- Early internal drafts: aim for 70-90% unless the user asks for a short proposal.
- Demos or tutorials may be shorter only when the user explicitly requests a non-publication sample. A smoke test is never a manuscript-length category or publication method substitute.
- Final submission: must be at or below the official limit after compression.

Slight mismatch is acceptable:

- Under target by <= 15%: acceptable for an internal draft if all required sections have substantive content.
- Under target by > 15%: inspect for missing substantive content. Expand supported explanations and planned evidence where useful; if evidence is insufficient, report the draft gap instead of padding.
- Over target by <= 10%: acceptable for a draft; schedule compression.
- Over target by > 10%: immediately run a standard compression pass or produce a cut plan before review.

## Section Budget

For AI/ML/CV/NLP-style 8-10 page main-body papers:

| Section | Typical share |
| --- | ---: |
| Abstract | 0.15-0.25 page |
| Introduction | 1.0-1.5 pages |
| Related Work / Background | 0.75-1.25 pages |
| Method | 2.0-3.0 pages |
| Experiments | 2.0-3.0 pages |
| Analysis / Ablation / required scope boundaries | 0.75-1.5 pages |
| Conclusion | 0.2-0.4 page |

Adjust by venue family:

- Systems/networking/security papers usually need more method, system design, threat model, implementation, and evaluation detail.
- Theory papers need theorem statements, proof ideas, and technical overview in the main text.
- HCI papers need research questions, participants, procedure, measures, ethics, and analysis method.
- Database/mining papers need problem formalization, algorithm details, complexity, datasets, baselines, and scalability analysis.

## Expansion Before Compression

If a full manuscript is under target, expand in this order:

1. Sharpen the Introduction challenge chain and contribution/evidence preview.
2. Add a focused Related Work contrast with closest-work groups.
3. Make the Method auditable: notation, module motivation, algorithm/pipeline, complexity, assumptions.
4. Add experiment setup details: datasets, metrics, baselines, implementation, hyperparameters.
5. Add main-result, ablation, robustness, and efficiency scaffolds using confirmed method versions.
6. Add venue-required ethics/reproducibility material and appendix pointers where expected; do not add generic limitations or hypothetical failure cases for padding.

Allowed expansion content:

- Mechanism explanations derived from the user's idea.
- `TBD` placeholders for missing results, figures, and citations.
- Experiment-table templates with empty cells.
- Evidence requirements and planned analyses.
- Clearly marked assumptions.

Forbidden expansion content:

- Invented numerical results.
- Invented citations or baselines.
- Unsupported claims of novelty, superiority, or reviewer reaction.
- Padding, generic field background, or repeated motivation.

## Expansion Content Order

When a manuscript is under target, expand in this priority order---each step adds substantive content, not filler:

1. **Introduction bottleneck exposition:** explain why existing methods fail structurally, not just empirically. Add concrete path-length, complexity, or capability arguments.
2. **Background/Preliminaries:** add formal problem definition, notation, and structural analysis (e.g., complexity tables, dependency path arguments).
3. **Method detail:** add per-component motivation (why this module, what gap it fills), forward equations, and connection to the global insight.
4. **Experiment setup:** add dataset statistics, preprocessing details, baselines with rationale, metric definitions, implementation notes.
5. **Results and analysis:** add result tables, complexity comparisons, and ablation motivations using confirmed full methods.
6. **Discussion:** add architecture-level analysis of why the method works and its evidenced regime of applicability.
7. **Required disclosures:** add only venue-required or scientifically material scope, ethics, reproducibility, and impact content; route judgment-sensitive wording through `ccf-humanization`.
8. **References:** ensure all cited works appear in the bibliography with complete metadata.

## Compile And Adjust Loop

When writing a TeX file and a LaTeX engine is available:

1. Compile once to measure pages.
2. Use normal bibliography/reference passes or a build tool such as latexmk. Investigate persistent errors or changing references rather than rerunning indefinitely.
3. Compare the PDF page count with the target budget.
4. If under target, expand actual explanatory gaps using supplied science; do not manufacture content to occupy pages.
5. If over target, run `references/compression-rules.md`.
6. Recompile after relevant changes. Stop when the requested draft is complete and relevant checks pass. If another pass makes no substantive progress, change the approach or name the concrete unresolved issue; do not run a page-count loop without progress.

If compilation is unavailable, estimate with section budgets and mark page count as `not compiled`.

## Output Status

For full manuscripts, include or record:

```text
Length budget:
Current length:
Status: underfilled / target-fit / draft-over / final-over / not compiled
Expansion or compression action:
Remaining evidence gaps:
```
