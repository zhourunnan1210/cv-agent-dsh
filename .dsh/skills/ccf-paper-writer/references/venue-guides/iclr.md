# ICLR Venue Guide

> Migrated from the legacy `ccf-conference-skills/iclr/SKILL.md` runtime skill during v0.4.0. This file is now reference material for `ccf-paper-writer` and `ccf-submission-checker`, not a standalone skill.

## Usage Boundary

- Use this file for LaTeX, page limit, anonymity, template, camera-ready, rebuttal-template, and venue-format details.
- Use `ccf-paper-writer` for actual paper writing and polishing.
- Use `ccf-paper-reviewer` or `ccf-submission-checker` for format audit, depending on whether the task is manuscript-facing or submission-package-facing.
- Verify current-year official rules before final submission.

# ICLR 2026 Conference Writing Skill

**CCF-A | AI | Publisher: OpenReview**
**Conference:** https://iclr.cc
**Template:** `ccf-latex-templates/ICLR/iclr2026_conference.sty`

## IMPORTANT: ICLR 2026 Is Double-Blind During Review

ICLR uses OpenReview, but the 2026 author guide states that submissions are double-blind during review.

This means:
1. Use the default `iclr2026_conference` style for under-review submissions; add `\iclrfinalcopy` only after acceptance.
2. Do not include author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, funding details, or identifying project links in the submitted PDF.
3. Cite prior work, including the authors' own public work, in the third person when needed.
4. Keep private code, supplementary, and artifact links anonymized until the venue permits de-anonymization.
5. Verify current official policy before final submission because OpenReview visibility and de-anonymization rules can change by year.

## Document Setup

### Preamble Structure

```latex
% === MODE SELECTION ===
\usepackage{iclr2026_conference}              % For submission/review
% OR:
\usepackage{iclr2026_conference}
\iclrfinalcopy                                % Camera-ready after acceptance

% Additional packages:
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{booktabs}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{url}
```

### Mode Options

| Mode | Option | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| Submission | default style | Under-review header and anonymous author block |
| Camera-Ready | `\iclrfinalcopy` | Published header and visible author block |

### Conditional Content

Use `\ificlrfinal` for content that differs between versions:

```latex
\ificlrfinal
  % Camera-ready specific content
  \section*{Acknowledgments}
\else
  % Submission specific content
\fi
```

## Page Limits

- ICLR 2026 submission: 9 pages for the main text, excluding references and appendix.
- Discussion and camera-ready versions: 10 pages for the main text, excluding references and appendix.
- Appendices and supplementary material are allowed but must follow current official instructions.
- Always re-check the official Author Guide before real submission.

## Title and Author Formatting

```latex
\title{Your Paper Title Here}

% Multi-author with \And and \AND:
\author{
  Anonymous Authors
}
```

### Affiliation Formatting

```latex
\affiliation{%
  \normalfont \centering
  \textbf{Institution Name} \\
  Address Line \\
  City, Country
}
```

## Abstract and Keywords

```latex
\begin{abstract}
Your abstract here. ICLR abstracts are typically 150-300 words.
Explain the problem, approach, and main contributions.
ICLR reviewers read abstracts carefully — make it compelling.
\end{abstract}

\keywords{keyword1 \and keyword2 \and keyword3}

```latex
% In document:
\bibliographystyle{iclr2026_conference}
\bibliography{references}

% Citations:

```latex
% Figure: include in single column or full width
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figure}
  \caption{Figure caption here.}
  \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

% For full-width figure:
\begin{figure*}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figure}
  \caption{Full-width figure caption.}

## ICLR-Specific Writing Conventions

### What ICLR Reviewers Value

1. **Clear motivation**: Why should we care about this problem?
2. **Novelty**: What is the new insight or approach?
3. **Theoretical depth**: Formal analysis and guarantees
4. **Empirical rigor**: Thorough experiments with strong baselines
5. **Reproducibility**: Sufficient detail to reproduce results
6. **Clarity**: Well-written, well-organized paper

### Theoretical Writing for ICLR

```latex
\section{Theoretical Analysis}

\begin{assumption}
\label{assum:1}
[State your assumptions clearly]
\end{assumption}

\begin{convergence}
\label{them:main}
Under Assumption \ref{assum:1}, the algorithm converges at rate...
\end{convergence}

\begin{Proof}
[Proof here]

```

### Experimental Rigor

```latex
\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Setup}
\textbf{Datasets:} We evaluate on standard benchmarks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CIFAR-10}: 50K training, 10K test images.
    \item \textbf{ImageNet}: 1.2M training, 50K validation images.
    \item \textbf{GLUE}: 9 NLU tasks.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Baselines:} We compare against:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Standard methods from literature
    \item State-of-the-art approaches on each benchmark
    \item Ablation variants of our method
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Implementation:} PyTorch. All experiments on NVIDIA A100 GPUs.
Learning rate: 1e-3, batch size: 256, trained for 100 epochs.
Hyperparameters selected via validation set tuning.

\textbf{Statistics:} Results are mean $\pm$ std over 5 seeds.
Statistical significance via paired t-test.

\subsection{Main Results}
\autoref{tab:main} shows our method achieves state-of-the-art
across all benchmarks, improving over previous best by X\%.

\subsection{Ablation Study}
\autoref{tab:ablation} shows the contribution of each component.

## OpenReview-Specific Requirements

Since papers are **not anonymous**:

1. **Include author information** — required for submission
2. **PDF metadata** — should contain author names
3. **Self-citations** — no special anonymization needed
4. **Dual submissions** — must be declared on OpenReview
5. **Camera-ready** — update with final author information

### Dual Submission Policy

ICLR has strict dual submission rules:
- Cannot submit the same paper to ICLR and another venue simultaneously
- Must withdraw from other venues if accepted at ICLR
- Can submit to arXiv before ICLR deadline (encouraged)
- Check current CFP for exact rules

### Preprint/ArXiv Policy

ICLR allows (and often encourages) posting preprints on arXiv:
- No special anonymization needed
- Can cite your own arXiv preprint
- arXiv posting is encouraged for reproducibility

## Rebuttal Period

ICLR has a mandatory rebuttal period where authors can respond to reviews.

### Rebuttal Structure

```latex
\section*{Response to Reviewers}

We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful comments and detailed feedback.

\textbf{Regarding Reviewer X's concern about Y:}
We appreciate this observation. To address this concern, we:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Added new experiments showing Z (see Figure X in this response)
    \item Clarified our approach in the revised paper
    \item Acknowledged this limitation in the conclusion
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Regarding the comparison with method A:}
We have added method A to our comparison. Results show our method
outperforms A by X\% on the primary metric.

\textbf{Regarding the theoretical assumptions:}
The reviewer raises an important point. We have added a more
rigorous analysis in the appendix showing that the assumption can
be relaxed to...
```

### Rebuttal Best Practices

**DO:**
- Thank reviewers for their time
- Address every concern specifically
- Provide new evidence when asked
- Be humble and constructive
- Clarify misunderstandings politely

**DON'T:**
- Be defensive or dismissive
- Argue about scores
- Make excuses
- Promise changes you can't deliver
- Be rude or aggressive
