## Security-Specific Writing Conventions

### Network Security Focus
NDSS papers typically focus on:
- Network protocol vulnerabilities
- Distributed system security
- Protocol design and analysis
- Real-world attack demonstrations
- Measurement studies of security phenomena

### Threat Model Section (Critical for Security Papers)

The threat model is the foundation of any security paper. Structure it clearly:

```latex
\section{Threat Model}
We assume an adversary with the following capabilities:

\textbf{Adversary's Goals:} The adversary aims to [achieve X, violate Y property].

\textbf{Adversary's Capabilities:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Network access:} The adversary can intercept, modify, and
    inject network traffic on [channel X].
    \item \textbf{Computational resources:} The adversary has [bounded/unbounded]
    computational power.
    \item \textbf{Prior knowledge:} The adversary knows [protocol details,
    public keys, etc.].
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Security Goals:} Our system should ensure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Confidentiality:} [What should remain secret]
    \item \textbf{Integrity:} [What should not be tampered with]
    \item \textbf{Availability:} [The system should remain available for...]
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Trust Assumptions:} We assume:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The underlying cryptographic primitives (AES, SHA-256) are secure.
    \item The trusted platform module is correctly implemented.
    \item [Other assumptions...]
\end{itemize}
```

### Attack/Defense Structure

Organize security papers as follows:

```latex
\section{Introduction}
% Problem statement, motivation, contributions (numbered)

\section{Background}
% Protocol/system overview, relevant prior work

\section{System Design}
% Architecture, protocol details, design rationale

\section{Security Analysis}
% Proof of security, threat model, attack surface analysis

\section{Implementation}
% Prototype details, challenges, optimizations

\section{Evaluation}
% Benchmarks, comparison with alternatives, case studies

\section{Discussion}
% Limitations, deployment considerations, future work

\section{Related Work}
% Positioning against prior security work

\section{Conclusion}
```

### Attack Description Structure

For papers describing vulnerabilities or attacks:

```latex
\section{Vulnerability Analysis}

\subsection{Background}
Describe the system/protocol being analyzed.

\subsection{Vulnerability Discovery}
How did you find this vulnerability?
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manual code review
    \item Fuzzing with [tool]
    \item Protocol state machine analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Vulnerability Details}
Describe the vulnerability precisely:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Affected component: [Component X, version Y]
    \item Root cause: [Buffer overflow, race condition, etc.]
    \item CVSS score: [If applicable]
    \item CVE ID: [If assigned]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exploitation}
Step-by-step attack procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Attacker sends [X] to victim...
    \item Victim responds with [Y]...
    \item Attacker exploits [Z]...
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Impact Assessment}
Real-world impact:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of affected users/systems
    \item Potential confidentiality/integrity/availability impact
    \item Attack complexity and prerequisites
\end{itemize}

\section{Countermeasures}
Proposed defenses with detailed description.
```

### Responsible Disclosure

For real-world vulnerabilities:

```latex
\section{Responsible Disclosure}
We disclosed this vulnerability to [vendor] on [date].
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Date]: Initial disclosure to [vendor]
    \item [Date]: Vendor acknowledged receipt
    \item [Date]: Vendor confirmed vulnerability
    \item [Date]: Patch released / CVE assigned
    \item [Date]: Public disclosure (90-day deadline met)
\end{itemize}

We worked with [CVE Number] and coordinated disclosure with [vendor].
```

## Section Ordering (Recommended)

1. **Abstract** — 150-250 words
2. **Introduction** — Problem, contributions, roadmap
3. **Background** — System model, relevant protocols, threat model
4. **Design/Approach** — Technical contribution
5. **Implementation** — Prototype, deployment challenges
6. **Evaluation** — Methodology, results, baselines
7. **Related Work** — Context within literature
8. **Discussion** — Limitations, deployment considerations
9. **Conclusion** — Summary
10. **References**
11. **Appendix** — Additional proofs, evaluations

## Figure and Table Guidelines

### Network Security Figures
- Protocol sequence diagrams (show message flow)
- System architecture diagrams
- Attack flow diagrams
- Packet captures or network traces (if applicable)
- Use vector graphics for scalability

```latex
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figs/protocol-flow}
  \caption{Sequence diagram showing the attack flow.
    Dashed lines indicate the attacker's actions.}
  \label{fig:protocol}
\end{figure}
```

### Evaluation Tables

```latex
\begin{table}
  \caption{Performance comparison of security mechanisms.
    All measurements are averages over 1000 runs.}
  \label{tab:perf}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
    \toprule
    Mechanism & Overhead & Memory & Security \\
    \midrule
    Baseline & 0ms & 1MB & None \\
    Our System & 2.3ms & 3.2MB & Strong \\
    Related Work & 5.1ms & 8.7MB & Moderate \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
```

- Compare against state-of-the-art defenses
- Include quantitative metrics (detection rate, overhead, etc.)
- Use booktabs-style formatting
- Clearly label units and metrics

## Reference Format

```latex
\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}
\bibliography{references}
```

- IEEE reference style: numbered citations `[1]`, `[2]`
- Full author names (not initials)
- Complete conference/journal names
