# CAV Venue Guide

> Migrated from the legacy `ccf-conference-skills/cav/SKILL.md` runtime skill during v0.4.0. This file is now reference material for `ccf-paper-writer` and `ccf-submission-checker`, not a standalone skill.

## Usage Boundary

- Use this file for LaTeX, page limit, anonymity, template, camera-ready, rebuttal-template, and venue-format details.
- Use `ccf-paper-writer` for actual paper writing and polishing.
- Use `ccf-paper-reviewer` or `ccf-submission-checker` for format audit, depending on whether the task is manuscript-facing or submission-package-facing.
- Verify current-year official rules before final submission.

## Anonymity Requirements

CAV uses double-blind review:

4. Anonymize all URLs, GitHub links, project pages
5. Clear PDF metadata
6. Remove acknowledgments

## Section Organization

CAV papers follow a formal verification paper structure:

1. **Abstract** — Theorem statements, brief verification methodology
2. **Introduction** — Problem, verification challenge, contributions
3. **Background & Preliminaries** — Formal definitions, notation
4. **Technical Approach** — Verification algorithm, encoding, reduction
5. **Proof of Correctness** — Theoretical guarantees
6. **Implementation & Experimental Results** — Tool, benchmarks, comparisons
7. **Related Work**
8. **Conclusion**
9. References
10. Appendix (optional)

## Theorem Environments

CAV uses standard theorem environments:

```latex
\theoremstyle{plain}
\newtheorem{definition}{Definition}
\newtheorem*{theorem}{Theorem}
\newtheorem*{lemma}{Lemma}
\newtheorem*{corollary}{Corollary}
\newtheorem*{invariant}{Invariant}
\newtheorem*{property}{Property}

% Example with label:
\begin{definition}[Transition System]
  \label[definition]{def:ts}
  A \emph{transition system} $TS$ is a tuple
  $(S, S_0, R, L)$ where $S$ is a finite set of states,
  $S_0 \subseteq S$ is the set of initial states,
  $R \subseteq S \times S$ is the transition relation, and
  $L: S \to 2^{AP}$ is a labeling function.
\end{definition}
```

## CAV-Specific Writing Conventions

### Introduction Structure

```latex
\section{Introduction}
% Paragraph 1: Problem and motivation
Verification of [system/class] is challenging because [reasons].
Errors in such systems can lead to [consequences].

% Paragraph 2: Gap in prior work
Existing verification techniques face limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Technique A] achieves [benefit] but requires [limitation].
    \item [Technique B] handles [case] but scales poorly to [scale].
\end{itemize}

% Paragraph 3: Our approach
In this paper, we propose a new approach that addresses these challenges.
Our key insight is that [insight].

% Paragraph 4: Contributions (numbered)
Our main contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We present a new verification algorithm for [problem] with [benefit].
    \item We prove the algorithm's correctness and complexity.
    \item We implement the approach in a tool and evaluate on benchmarks.
\end{itemize}
```

### Verification Proofs

CAV proofs typically involve invariant arguments or reduction proofs:

```latex
\section{Correctness Proof}

\begin{main*}[Soundness]
  \label[main*]{thm:soundness}
  The verification algorithm of \autoref{sec:algorithm}
  returns \texttt{SAFE} only if the program $P$ satisfies
  the specification $\varphi$.
\end{main*}

\begin{Proof}
  We prove by induction on the number of refinement steps.

  \textbf{Base Case.} Initially, the abstract domain $D_0$ contains
  exactly the set of reachable states, so $D_0 \models \varphi$
  implies $P \models \varphi$.

  \textbf{Inductive Step.} Assume that after $i$ refinement steps,
  $D_i \models \varphi$ implies $P \models \varphi$.
  The $(i+1)$-th refinement $D_{i+1}$ adds constraints that are
  logically implied by $D_i$. Therefore...

  By induction, when the algorithm terminates with $D_n \models \varphi$,
  we have $P \models \varphi$.
\end{Proof}
```

### Reduction Proofs

```latex
\begin{main*}[Reduction to SAT]
  \label[main*]{thm:reduction}
  The model checking problem for [class] is polynomial-time
  reducible to SAT.
\end{main*}

\begin{Proof}
  We construct a formula $\varphi$ such that:
  \[
  M \models \varphi \iff M \models \text{SPEC}
  \]
  The construction proceeds as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Encode each variable $x_i$ as a fresh propositional variable.
      \item Encode each transition as a clause.
      \item Encode the property as a propositional formula.
  \end{enumerate}
  The size of $\varphi$ is $O(n^2)$ where $n$ is the size of $M$.
\end{Proof}
```

## Implementation Description

CAV papers require implementation details:

```latex
\section{Implementation}
We implemented our approach in a tool called \toolname.
\toolname{} is built on top of the \zthree{} SMT solver
and uses the following key data structures:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Constraint graph:} A directed graph where nodes
    represent program variables and edges represent dependency relations.
  \item \textbf{Abstraction cache:} A hash map from program locations
    to abstract states, enabling efficient join operations.
\end{itemize}

The tool consists of approximately 15,000 lines of OCaml code
and exposes a command-line interface compatible with the SV-COMP format.
```

## Experimental Evaluation

CAV evaluation uses standard benchmarks:

```latex
\section{Experimental Evaluation}
We evaluated \toolname{} on the SV-COMP 2025 benchmark suite
and compared it against two state-of-the-art tools:
Spacer~\citep{padhi} and FreqHorn~\citep{horn}.

\begin{table}[t]
  \caption{Results on SV-COMP benchmark (1,234 benchmarks).
    Timeout set to 300s. Best results in bold.}
  \label{tab:results}
  \begin{tabular}{lcccccc}
    \toprule
    Category & \toolname & Spacer & FreqHorn \\
    \midrule
    Control flow & 145/150 & 142/150 & 138/150 \\
    Concurrency & \textbf{89/100} & 82/100 & 76/100 \\
    Arrays & \textbf{203/220} & 198/220 & 189/220 \\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Total} & \textbf{437/470} & 422/470 & 403/470 \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
```
