# PPoPP Venue Guide

> Migrated from the legacy `ccf-conference-skills/ppopp/SKILL.md` runtime skill during v0.4.0. This file is now reference material for `ccf-paper-writer` and `ccf-submission-checker`, not a standalone skill.

## Usage Boundary

- Use this file for LaTeX, page limit, anonymity, template, camera-ready, rebuttal-template, and venue-format details.
- Use `ccf-paper-writer` for actual paper writing and polishing.
- Use `ccf-paper-reviewer` or `ccf-submission-checker` for format audit, depending on whether the task is manuscript-facing or submission-package-facing.
- Verify current-year official rules before final submission.

## Migrated Venue Notes

# PPoPP 2026 Conference Writing Skill

**CCF-A | Architecture | Publisher: ACM**
**Conference:** https://ppopp26.sigplan.org/
**Template:** `PPoPP/acmart.cls` (ACM acmart, SIGPLAN format)

## Document Setup

### Preamble Structure

```latex
% === SUBMISSION MODE (anonymous, double-blind) ===
\documentclass[sigplan,review,anonymous]{acmart}
\settopmatter{printfolios=true}

% === CAMERA-READY MODE ===
\documentclass[sigplan]{acmart}
\acmConference[PPoPP 2026]{31st ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles...}
               {February 22--26, 2026}{Montreal, Canada}
\acmISBN{978-X-XXXX-XXXX-X/XX/XX}
\acmDOI{10.5555/XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX}
```

### Required Packages

```latex
\usepackage[round]{natbib}     % Author-year citations
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage[noend]{algorithmic}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsthm}
\usepackage{listings}
\lstset{basicstyle=\small\ttfamily}
\usepackage{newalg}             % Alternative algorithm formatting
```

## Page Limits

| Section | Limit |
|---------|-------|
| Main paper (submission) | **12 pages** |
| References | No limit |
| Appendix | Not permitted |

PPoPP enforces a strict 12-page limit. There is **no appendix** and no supplementary materials in the traditional sense. All essential content must fit within the 12-page limit.

## Anonymity Requirements

Double-blind review with `anonymous` class option:

1. No author names anywhere in submission
2. Third-person self-citations: "Smith et al. showed..." not "we showed..."
3. Anonymize all URLs and external links
4. Clear PDF metadata
5. Do not include acknowledgments

## Camera-Ready Differences

After acceptance:

1. Remove `review` and `anonymous` options
2. Fill in `\acmConference`, `\acmISBN`, `\acmDOI`
3. Restore author names and affiliations
4. Add appropriate `\setcopyright` mode
5. Enable page numbers with `\settopmatter{printfolios=true}`

## Section Organization

PPoPP papers typically follow one of two patterns depending on whether the contribution is primarily theoretical or experimental:

### Theory-First Paper Structure

1. **Introduction** — Problem, contributions (state all theorems/lemmas as contributions)
2. **Background & Preliminaries** — Formal definitions, notation, related formalisms
3. **Algorithm / Program Transformation** — Full formal description with pseudocode
4. **Correctness Proof** — Theorems, lemmas, proofs establishing correctness
5. **Complexity Analysis** — Time/space bounds, work/span (or depth) analysis
6. **Related Work** — Comparison with prior algorithms and proofs
7. **Conclusion** — Summary and open problems
8. References

### Experimental Paper Structure

1. **Introduction** — Problem, contributions (enumerate algorithmic/performance contributions)
2. **Background & Motivation** — Why parallelization matters, challenges
3. **Algorithm Design** — Practical parallel algorithm with sufficient detail
4. **Implementation** — System-level details, optimizations, porting effort
5. **Evaluation** — Benchmarks, experimental setup, performance results
6. **Related Work** — Comparison with related parallel frameworks
7. **Conclusion**
8. References

## Algorithm Environments

PPoPP papers heavily use algorithm formatting. Use the `algorithm` + `algorithmic` packages:

```latex
\begin{algorithm}[t]
  \caption{Work-stealing task scheduler}
  \label{alg:steal}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \REQUIRE $n$ workers, task graph $G$
    \ENSURE All tasks completed

    \STATE $w \leftarrow \Call{GetWorkerID}{}$
    \WHILE{$\neg$\Call{AllDone}{$G$}}
      \STATE $t \leftarrow \Call{Steal}{w}$  \COMMENT{Take from random victim}
      \IF{$t \neq \text{null}$}
        \STATE $\Call{Execute}{t}$
      \ENDIF
    \ENDWHILE
  \RETURN
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

For termination, use `\WHILE`, `\FOR`, `\IF` with `\ELSIF`/`\ELSE`.

## Correctness and Complexity

PPoPP values rigorous correctness arguments. Present them formally:

```latex
\theoremstyle{plain}
\newtheorem*{theorem}{Theorem}
\newtheorem*{lemma}{Lemma}

\begin{theorem}[Work-stealing correctness]
  \label{th:steal}
  All tasks in $G$ are executed, and no task is executed twice.
\end{theorem}

\begin{Proof}
  % formal proof ...
\end{Proof}
```

For parallel complexity, analyze in terms of:
- **Work**: total operations across all processors
- **Span (Depth)**: longest chain of dependencies
- **Speedup**: $T_1 / T_p$ for $p$ processors

```latex
\begin{restatable}{theorem}{spanbound}
  \label{th:span}
  The algorithm has span $O(\log n)$ with high probability.
\end{restatable}
```

## Figures and Tables

- Use vector formats (.pdf) for all plots and diagrams
- Ensure grayscale legibility
- Number figures/tables sequentially
- Captions should state what to observe and why it matters

```latex
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{figs/scaling}
  \caption{Strong scaling on 16-core machine. Our algorithm achieves
    near-linear speedup up to 8 cores, outperforming the
    state-of-the-art by $2.1\times$ at 16 cores.}
  \label{fig:scaling}
\end{figure}
```

## References (natbib)

```latex
\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
\bibliography{references}

\citet{bandis2024}      % Bandis et al. (2024)
\citep{bandis2024}      % (Bandis et al. 2024)
```

All references must list **all authors** by full name.

## Formatting Rules

- **Format:** ACM sigplan (two-column, single-spaced)
- **Paper size:** US Letter
- **Body font:** 9pt minimum
- **References:** 8pt, unlimited pages
- **Margins:** Top/bottom 1in, sides 0.75in, column gap 0.25in

## PPoPP Writing Conventions

- **Algorithmic detail**: Present sufficient pseudocode for reproducibility; the algorithm should be implementable from the description
- **Correctness arguments**: Prove correctness, not just claim it; include lemmas that break down the argument
- **Complexity analysis**: Always provide work and span/depth bounds; compare with known bounds from related work
- **Experimental methodology**: Use established benchmarks where available; report variance across runs; state hardware platform and OS
- **No supplementary appendix**: all essential content must fit within 12 pages
