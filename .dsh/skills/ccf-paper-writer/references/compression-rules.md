# Compression Rules

Use this file to reduce length while preserving the paper's story, evidence, and venue fit.

Compression is triggered when a manuscript exceeds the target venue budget or the user's requested word/page limit. It is the counterpart to `length-budget-policy.md`: underfilled manuscripts should be expanded, overfilled manuscripts should be compressed.

## Mode Selection

Quick mode:

- One paragraph, one subsection, local polish, or a simple word-count reduction.
- Do not require a full checklist.
- Preserve facts and numbers exactly.
- Return compact risk status.

Standard mode:

- Full section, multi-section, full manuscript, page-limit, or camera-ready compression.
- Build a content inventory and appendix/delete decision table.
- Check claim-evidence preservation.
- Ask once before appendix/delete if the user's preference is unknown.

If a draft is only slightly over budget (<= 10%), first compress wording, repeated motivation, and low-value background. If it is substantially over budget (> 10%), create a section-level cut plan before rewriting.

## Compression Hierarchy

Cut in this order:

1. Repeated motivation.
2. Generic field background.
3. Unnecessary adjectives and promotional phrasing.
4. Duplicate definitions.
5. Overlong transitions.
6. Implementation details that can move to appendix.
7. Secondary experiments or extended analyses that can move to appendix.
8. Low-impact related work sentences after the closest work is covered.
9. Optional caveats that duplicate the Limitations section.

Protect:

- Central problem and root challenge.
- Core insight and method mechanism.
- Claims tied to contributions.
- Numbers, metrics, datasets, and baseline names.
- Limitations that bound overclaiming.
- Reproducibility details required by the venue.
- Ethics, threat model, or user-study details when required.

## Appendix/Delete Decision

Move to appendix when:

- The material is important for audit but not needed for first-pass understanding.
- It is extended derivation, proof detail, extra tables, hyperparameters, implementation detail, or secondary analysis.
- The main text already states the takeaway.

Delete when:

- The material repeats an earlier point.
- The claim is unsupported and not essential.
- The wording is generic venue boilerplate.
- The citation is background-only and not needed for positioning.
- The sentence increases confidence without adding evidence.

Ask once when the choice is strategic:

```text
I recommend moving reproducibility detail and secondary analyses to appendix, and deleting repeated motivation and unsupported filler. Should I apply that policy for this compression pass?
```

If the user already asked for aggressive deletion, appendix-only compression, or camera-ready condensation, do not ask again.

## Venue Style

AI/ML/CV/NLP:

- Keep the problem, insight, method mechanism, and evidence summary visible.
- Compress background and low-impact related work first.
- Keep ablation and baseline rationale clear enough to avoid reviewer suspicion.

DB/systems/networks:

- Keep workload, deployment assumptions, architecture, bottleneck, and end-to-end results.
- Move lower-level implementation and extra sensitivity studies to appendix if needed.

Security:

- Keep threat model, assumptions, guarantees, and ethics/disclosure scope.
- Do not compress away boundary conditions.

HCI:

- Keep research questions, participant/procedure essentials, analysis method, and claim scope.
- Move instrument details or long coding examples to appendix.

Theory/PL/FM:

- Keep theorem statement, assumptions, proof idea, and relation to prior bounds.
- Move proof details but not proof roadmap.

## Sentence-Level Moves

- Replace broad openings with specific problem statements.
- Merge citations that support the same contrast.
- Convert repeated clauses into one scoped claim.
- Use one term consistently rather than alternating synonyms.
- Prefer "because" and "therefore" relations over long rhetorical bridges.
- Replace verbose contribution bullets with claim + evidence pairs.
- Remove defensive hedges, unexplained labels, punctuation-heavy chains, and third-person manuscript narration before cutting substantive content.
- Preserve sentence rhythm; do not compress every sentence into the same short template.

## Risk Labels

Use these labels after compression:

- `preserved`: claim/evidence still intact.
- `weakened`: claim was narrowed to match evidence.
- `moved-to-appendix`: detail removed from main flow but still available.
- `deleted`: removed because redundant or unsupported.
- `risk`: compression may harm clarity or auditability.
